description: Answer questions about a real product's current price, stock, rating, specs, or images by calling Apify's E-commerce Scraping Tool over MCP, across Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay, and 75 more retailers. Trigger on "what does X cost right now", "is X in stock", "compare the price of X across stores", "find me a Y under $Z", "how much is this", "check this product URL", or any product question where a stale answer would be wrong. Use whenever answering from training data or a web search would risk quoting an out-of-date price.

# Apify product lookup

Fetch live product facts instead of guessing at them. Requires the Apify MCP server to be connected; if the tool is missing, see the `apify-product-data-setup` skill.

## Try this tool first, whatever the retailer

The Actor's `marketplaces` input lists the retailers with dedicated extractors, and it
is not the boundary of what works. Unlisted sites fall back to generic extraction,
which is enabled by default, so **a URL from a shop you have never heard of is still
worth sending.**

So the order is always:

1. Send the URL or keyword to this tool, regardless of whether the retailer appears in
   `marketplaces`.
2. If the result is unusable, re-read the URL. An item with every field empty usually
   means the URL does not resolve, not that the retailer is unsupported.
3. Only after that, look for a retailer-specific Actor in Apify Store. See
   [Falling back to Apify Store](#falling-back-to-apify-store).

Do not skip step 1 because a domain is missing from the list. That reasoning sends
users away from a tool that would have answered them.

## Pick the input before calling

The Actor takes different inputs for different questions. Choosing wrong wastes a paid run.

| The question | Input to send |
|---|---|
| About a specific page the user gave you | `detailsUrls: [{"url": "..."}]` |
| "Find me a X under $Y" with no URL | `keyword` plus `marketplaces` |
| "Compare X across stores" | `keyword` plus several `marketplaces` |
| Food delivery catalogs | `keywordDelivery` plus `marketplacesDelivery` |

Always send `maxProductResults` and `additionalProperties: true`. Without the second, stock and rating are missing entirely, because they are nested there.

## The call is two tool calls

1. Call `apify--e-commerce-scraping-tool` (two hyphens, not a slash). It returns run metadata and a `datasetId`. **It does not return products.**
2. Call `get-dataset-items` with that `datasetId` and a `limit`. The products come back here.

Stopping after the first call is the most common failure. The first result looks successful and contains no product data.

## Read the fields defensively

Field names, types, and nesting vary by retailer. See `references/fields.md` for the full map. The four that bite hardest:

- **`offers.price`** is a number on some retailers and a string like `"398.99"` on others. Parse both.
- **Stock and rating live under `additionalProperties`**, as `inStock` and `stars`, not at the top level. The top-level `rating` was `null` on a product whose `stars` was `4.2`.
- **`brand`** may be `{"slogan": "Visit the Sony Store"}`. That is UI text, not a brand. Strip the wrapper or omit the brand.
- **`offers.priceCurrency`** is a symbol (`"$"`) on some retailers and an ISO code (`"USD"`) on others. A symbol butts against the number, a code takes a space.

## Answer honestly

**Say when the data was read.** "As of just now" or the timestamp. The whole point of calling the tool is that the answer is current, so make that visible.

**Never claim a product is unavailable because stock was absent.** Many retailers do not report it. Absent means unknown, so say "the retailer does not report stock" rather than "out of stock".

**If every field comes back empty, suspect the URL before the retailer.** The Actor returns an item with no fields rather than an error, and the most common cause is a URL that does not resolve. Do not report it as a product with no price, and do not conclude the retailer is unsupported until the URL has been checked.

**Quote the source URL** so the user can check, and include the image URL when they asked to see the item.

## Falling back to Apify Store

Only when this tool has genuinely failed on a good URL, and generic extraction did not
produce a name or a price.

Search Apify Store for an Actor covering that retailer, run it, and answer from its
output. Two things to carry into that:

- **The output shape will not match.** The field map in `references/fields.md` describes
  this Actor. Another Actor has its own schema, so read what it actually returns rather
  than assuming `offers.price` exists.
- **Say which source answered.** If the reply came from a different Actor, the freshness
  and coverage caveats are that Actor's, not this one's.

If the connection is scoped with `?tools=`, Store search is not available on it. Report
that the retailer is not covered rather than pretending to search.

## Cost

The Actor bills a start event per call plus per product returned, so:

- Cap with `maxProductResults`. Five is plenty for a comparison; one for a single lookup.
- Prefer one call with several URLs or marketplaces over several calls.
- Do not re-run to "check" a result you already have.

## Gotchas

- Stopping after the first tool call returns run metadata that reads like success and contains no products.
- A retailer missing from `marketplaces` is not a reason to skip the call. Generic extraction is on by default, so unlisted shops frequently work. The listed ones have dedicated extractors and deeper field coverage.
- Omitting `additionalProperties: true` silently drops stock, rating, list price, and identifiers.
- `rating: 0` and `stars: 0` mean absent, not a zero-star product.
- A `listPrice` above the current price is a genuine discount; report the percentage, it is usually what the user wanted.
- One Amazon product came back in about 10 seconds. Other retailers are slower by a wide margin, so for a multi-retailer comparison tell the user it will take a moment rather than going silent.
- `additionalProperties` can run to roughly 100 KB per product. Never paste it into a reply; read the fields you need.
- The `?tools=` parameter on the server URL narrows which Actors are visible. If the tool is absent, the connection may be scoped to other Actors.
